# Linear Cryptanalysis
We have done a course project in our course CS406 we will be performing linear cryptanalysis on basic Substitution Permutation Network(SPN) Cipher. We have recovered the 8 bits of subkey(16 bits) of last round from K_[5,6,7,8] and K_[13,14,15,16]. We will get PASS if we got the correct parts of subkey and Failure for any other case. We have clearly explained what we have done in the report and run the code for testing. We have also explained how to recover subkeys for diffrent rounds by taking valid equations from Linear Approximation table you can see that in our report.

### Running Instruction
   * `python3 linear_cryptanalysis.py`
